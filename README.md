# Face-and-Digit-Classification
There are two data sets, one of images of digits and the other of faces. The algorithms, Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and k Nearest Neighbor attempt to determine which digit the digit image is and whether the face image is a face or not.

Run .\TA_PRESENTATION.PS1 in powershell to see the basic performance of each algorithm.
